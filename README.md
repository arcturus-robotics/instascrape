# Instascrape

A bot to help keep track of our Instagram followers.

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in a file named `config.toml`.

To keep track of our Instagram every 6 hours, for example, you would write the following:

```toml
# https://www.instagram.com/arcturusrobotics/
user = "arcturusrobotics"
# 21600 seconds = 6 hours
interval = 21600
```
